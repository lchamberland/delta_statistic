Codes for calculating $\delta$, a phylogenetic analog of the Shannon entropy for measuring the degreed of phylogenetic signal between a categorical trait (trait vector) and a phylogeny (metric-tree). 

Please make sure you have the "ape" package instaled before running the examples or using these codes for your own purposes.
